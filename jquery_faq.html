<h1> Top Ten FAQ about National Parks</h1>
<button id="showAnswers" href="">Show answers</button>

<dl>
    <dt> Can I drink alcohol in a state park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">It is against park rules to drink or display an alcoholic beverage in a public place at any
        time. All outdoor areas are public in a state park. Also, we cannot sell alcoholic beverages within a state
        park.
        <a href="">Refer to Texas State Park Regulations 59.134 (b). </a></dd>

    <dt>Can I ride my bike in state parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Almost all state parks offer road or mountain biking, or both! Many parks have long stretches
        of road (some winding and hilly). Many of our parks have multiuse trails. Visit our<a href=""> Biking page </a>for
        detailed information
    </dd>

    <dt>Where can I go birding? Do you have a bird checklist?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You can bird at any state park! For a short list of great parks for birding, visit our Birding
        page. See a complete list of Bird Checklists on our Publications page. You might want to check out the Great
        Texas Wildlife Trails, which list places to see wildlife around the state, including in state parks.
    </dd>

    <dt>Which state parks were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"><a href="">Go to our <a href="">CCC web page</a> for more information. </a></dd>

    <dt>Can I bring my pet to a state park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You can bring your pets to almost all state parks! However, we do have some rules:
        <ul>
            <li>Pets must be on leash, in a car, or in a crate at all times. The leash can be no longer than 6 feet.
            </li>
            <li>You must be with your pet at all times. You may not leave your pet unattended in the park, in a vehicle,
                or at your campsite.
            </li>
            <li>Do not bring a noisy or dangerous dog to a state park.</li>
            <li>Pets are not allowed in any state park buildings. This includes motels, cabins, screened shelters, group
                facilities and restrooms.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I fly a drone or other remote control aircraft in a state park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Two parks offer zones for flying remote controlled aircraft (including drones): <a href="">Lake
        Whitney</a> and
        <a href="">San Angelo.</a> You can request a filming permit for your craft at any park by contacting that park.
        Allow several weeks for us to review your request.
    </dd>

    <dt> Is geocaching allowed in Texas State Parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Yes! Almost every state park has at least one geocache. Learn more about geocaching on our <a
            href="">Geocaching page.</a></dd>

    <dt>May I carry my handgun into a state park when I am traveling?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Our rules state that you may not show/display or fire your gun in a state park. If you have a
        valid Handgun License, you may carry your handgun in many state parks. But even with a HL, handguns are not
        allowed in parks that are leased from the federal government. Check with the park before you go. Refer to<a
                href="">Texas State Park Regulations for specific regulations - 59.134(d).</a></dd>

    <dt>Where can I find information on hiking at Texas State Parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You can hike at most state parks! Check out our <a href="">Hikes & Nature Walks page</a>
        for some ideas.
